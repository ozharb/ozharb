### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Frontend engineer with a proven ability to deliver robust, responsive React applications in collaborative settings under strict and often tight time constraints.  As a former paralegal, I prepared and filed over 200 green card applications with a 100% approval rate and zero missed deadlines ensuring I communicate effectively, commit to achieving objectives, take initiative, and contribute a passionate work ethic to every project. Always seeking personal growth, I expanded my coding acumen through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on Javascript and React. I am now eager to apply strong communication, initiative, and creativity to obtain a challenging position on a collaborative agile development team focused on building high-quality, intuitive front-end applications that incorporate functional Javascript programming, semantic HTML, and responsive CSS.
